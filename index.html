A lot to take in... eh? Well there is a lot of work to get to the height of a Jedi Grandmaster. Of course, the highest rank will only be the General in the Rebel Alliance if you do not have any Jedi powers. Leave now, CHILD. We have no room for amateurs and pathetic soldiers. Still staring at me with a straight face convinces me you infact ARE ready. I am going to take you through the ranks, and how to survive each one, if you can... 
</p>
<h2>Light Side Empathizer</h2>
<p>Becoming fond of the Light Side it seems? If you are an empathizer, you can live a simple life, free from battles. But beware, if stormtroopers come, you must not reveal that you empathize with the light side of the force. <br>
<h2>Rebel</h1>
<p>
Oh, moving quickly are we? Now you have a permit to converse smoothly with your fellow Light Side. <br>Work small chores to earn your rations and your shelter.</p>
<h2>In the Rebel Alliance</h2>
<p>A promotion? Pretty nice.<br> But you will need more courage to face these new dangers.<br> Now you are enlisted by the rebel alliance,
 you will need to follow all orders and commands.<br> You will fight now and go on missions. If you fail, you will move down ranks. <br>Be wise now, Rebel.</p>
<h2>Fighter in the Rebel Alliance</h2>
<p>Defending for what you believe in is all of this rank in a nutshell.<br> Be careful since failure inevitably leads to your death.</p>
<h2>General in the Rebel Alliance</h2>
<p>Now you have respect from all levels below you. Lead your powerful army to victory.
<h1><em>Jedi Ranks<em></h1>
<p>These are the Ranks that You Have to Follow if You Show Signs of The Force. You will have more power<br> and more control in your world. There is lots of danger as well.</p>
<h2><em>Jedi Padawan</em></h2>
<p>Working as a very powerful weapon in the army, you must run in to battle with strength and fire!<br> You will also be training while there is no one to fight</p>
<h2><em>Jedi Knight</em></h2>
<p>You will be the main Jedi force (pun intended) on the battlefield. You will frequently be sent<br> on missions to defeat evil in the galaxy. Please be careful, you are very valuable now. </p>
<h2><em>Jedi Master</em></h2>
<p>It feels like yesterday, but now you have reached Jedi Master. Your training and instincts<br> guide you on the path to strength and courage. You see the power you seek, but<br> you are respectful to those above you.</p>
<h2><em>Jedi Master</em></h2>
<p>As your strengths keep growing, you use your power for great work in combat and industrial purposes.
<h2><em>Jedi Grandmaster (Literally Just Yoda)</em></h2>
<p>Reaching old age, much wisdom, and seemingly endless power, you reflect back on your journey and your fellow <br>light side peers below you. You stand by your friends and family defend your name and your beliefs. As sit there happy with success, <br>you wait. Waiting for the next Light Side Empathizer to be like you. You have come a long way. I am actually proud of you.<br> You have faced many dangers and you are very wise. You will not fight as much any more. Instead you will go to a Jedi <br>Temple to study for the rest of your life (yay!). You will also help train the<br> next generation of rebels and Jedi. May the Force Be with You...</p>

<h1>How to Survive as a Normal Rebel (Not Part of the Rebel Alliance)</h1>
<h2>Shelter<h2>
<p>So you will need a proper shelter to stay safe from the elements and people. The first step for getting a shelter is picking a planet. Some peaceful planets include: Naboo, Tatooine, and Coruscant. If you want a bit more adventure some planets to go to are: Endor and Coruscant (It is pretty peaceful though). Make sure to make your house out of strong materials.</p>
<h2>A Ship<h2>
	<p>Ships are essential for all people in the galaxy some good, reliable ships are: The X-Wing, The Jedi Starfighter, if you can somehow steal it from Han Solo, the Millenium Falcon.</p>
	<h2>Weapons</h2>
	<p>Ah... the weapons. There are many good ones to pick including the lightsaber (if you are a jedi), a blaster, and wrist rockets.</p>s
